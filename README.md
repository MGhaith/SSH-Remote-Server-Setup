# SSH Remote Server Setup(WIP)

This project demonstrates how to set up a basic Linux server on AWS, configure it for SSH connections, and manage multiple SSH key pairs.

# Setup
## Manual Setup

### 1. Provision a Remote Linux Server (AWS EC2)

1. Log in to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

2. Go to EC2 and launch a new instance:

    - Choose Amazon Linux 2023 (or latest stable version).

    - Select a free-tier eligible instance type (e.g., `t3.micro`).

    - Configure networking â†’ allow inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH).

    - Download the default AWS key pair (`aws-key.pem`) or create your own.

    - Launch the instance.

3. Locate and copy your instance Public DNS in the EC2 dashboard.
### 2. Connect to the Server with AWS Key
```bash
chmod 400 aws-key.pem
ssh -i aws-key.pem user@<server-DNS>
```
> **Note**: In the default AWS setting the the EC2 server user is `ec2-user`.
### 3. Create Two New SSH Key Pairs
> **Note**: In this step, we create two new SSH key pairs. This is not a necessary step.

On your local machine:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/key1 -C "key1"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/key2 -C "key2"
```

This creates:
- `~/.ssh/key1` and `~/.ssh/key1.pub`
- `~/.ssh/key2` and `~/.ssh/key2.pub`
### 4. Add Public Keys to the Server

On the server (`user@<server-DNS>`):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

Append both public keys to authorized_keys:
```bash
echo "<contents-of-key1.pub>" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
echo "<contents-of-key2.pub>" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
### 5. Test SSH Connections with Both Keys

From your local machine:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/key1 user@<server-DNS>
ssh -i ~/.ssh/key2 user@<server-DNS>
```
Both should log you into the server successfully.

### 6. Configure ~/.ssh/config

To simplify connections, edit ~/.ssh/config on your local machine:
```bash
Host myserver-key1
    HostName <server-DNS>
    User user
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key1

Host myserver-key2
    HostName <server-DNS>
    User user
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key2
```

Now you can connect with:
```bash
ssh myserver-key1
ssh myserver-key2
```
